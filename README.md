## Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values
- Encoded categorical variables
- Performed feature engineering
- Prepared training and testing datasets

### 2️⃣ Model Training
- Trained Machine Learning classification models
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy and classification metrics

### 3️⃣ Model Saving
- Saved the trained model using Joblib (.pkl file)

### 4️⃣ Prediction Generation
- Generated fraud prediction output file
- Prepared encoded dataset for Power BI visualization

### 5️⃣ Dashboard Development
Developed a multi-page interactive Power BI dashboard covering:

- **Overview** – Key fraud KPIs and summary metrics  
- **Location & Merchant Risk** – High-risk geographic and merchant analysis  
- **Device, Card & Transaction Analysis** – Fraud distribution by device, card type, and transaction category  
- **Fraud Alerts** – Identification of high-risk transactions  
- **Trend Analysis** – Time-based fraud patterns  
- **User Risk Profiling** – User-level fraud risk assessment  
- **Account Balance Analysis** – Fraud trends by balance and transaction amount  
- **Behavioral Analysis** – Historical fraud behavior insights  
- **Card & Age Analysis** – Fraud risk based on card type and card age  

The dashboard includes interactive slicers and dynamic filtering for detailed fraud investigation.
